# React Swift webview 

## Very WIP

## What is this?

This is a project built off of what was previously my [Swift web hybrid template](https://github.com/WillsonSmith/Swift-web-hybrid-template) that allowed you to use a webview, but call native code with JavaScript. When I originally built it, WKWebview was not on macOS, now it is, so I've updated to using that.

The system now uses message passing, so I have some async-await stuff to handle that.
